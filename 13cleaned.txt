  A flurry of activity has significantly beefed up   Maker Studios  ‘ most successful vertical. Four top YouTube gamers–  Captain Sparklez  ,   KSIOlajidebt  ,   Ali-A  , and   TheBajanCanadian  –have joined Maker and will be listed as members of   Polaris  , the network’s gaming division.  
 Polaris already counts a number of YouTube’s top gamers among its partners. The unstoppable Swedish force that is  PewDiePie  is well-represented on the vertical’s YouTube channel, as is top British gaming channel  The Yogscast ,  Toby Turner ,  Dodger , and many others. The four new gamers slot in nicely near the top of the vertical’s roster, and Polaris has now become the  seventh-most popular network on YouTube  in terms of subscribers, despite claiming a partner count that is merely a fraction of its competitors. 
 The four new members combine to bring in more than 150 million views a month and have 13 million subscribers between them. Like any well-balanced team, they also have a variety of different specialties. Sparklez and TheBajanCanadian (real name Mitch Hughes) are partial to  Minecraft , KSIOlajidebt (real name Jide Olatunji) is known for his  histrionic FIFA soccer matches , and Ali-A specializes in  Call of Duty . 
 “As we build out our roster of gamer personalities to engage a global audience with content that appeals to everyone from hard core to casual gamers, we sought out passionate new voices and content creators,” said   Dar Nothaft  , Vice President and general manager of Polaris.  “With Captain Sparklez, Jide, Ali-A and Mitch, we are taking Polaris to the next level.” 
 The Polaris vertical is one of a proposed 20 that will be shuffled around when  Maker re-organizes its network into four huge units . With its added firepower, the gaming hub is becoming a powerful YouTube network in its own right, without even taking its prosperous parent into consideration.
