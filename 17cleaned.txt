 The  Minecraft  business can be a lucrative one, not just for the people who make it, but also for the people who play it. Popular YouTube personality Jordan "CaptainSparklez" Maron, who primarily plays  Minecraft  on his channel, just dropped $4.5 million on a new house in the Hollywood Hills — not far from where the game's creator, Markus "Notch" Persson lives —  Variety  reports. 
 Notch made headlines last year for his record-setting  $70 million purchase of a house in Beverly Hills . CaptainSparklez's smaller, more reasonably priced pad is just a few thousand feet away from Notch's Trousdale Estates mansion, but getting back and forth between the two homes requires a much longer, winding drive through Hollywood's curving roads. 
 Maron's  YouTube channel  has more than 8.8 million subscribers and his Twitch channel has more than 1.2 million. On YouTube alone, he's racked up more than 1.9 billion views, which helps explain his ability to afford the new home. 
 The  Minecraft  streamer's new digs comes with three bedrooms, four bathrooms, an infinity pool with a nice view of Los Angeles and a three car garage. It does not, however, appear to have a  dedicated candy room . 
 If you want to take a peek at the kind of Hollywood Hills house 8.8 million subscribers can buy, or just want to solemnly regret not getting on the  Minecraft  streaming bandwagon early enough, you can check out pictures of the property at  Nicholas Property Group's website .
