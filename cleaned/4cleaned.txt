 A  creeper  is a fictional creature within the  sandbox game    Minecraft  . Creepers are hostile  mobs  (a mobile  non-player character ) that can spawn anywhere that is dark, but still survive in bright environments. Instead of attacking the player directly, they creep up on the player and explode when they get close, destroying blocks in the surrounding area and potentially hurting or killing the player if they are inside the blast radius. Their green  camouflage  and generally silent behavior aid in stealth attacks. Creepers were first added to  Minecraft  in a pre- alpha  update to the game that was released on September 1, 2009.
 
 The creeper has become one of the most widely recognized icons of  Minecraft . They have been referenced and parodied in  popular culture , and they are featured prominently in  Minecraft   merchandising  and  advertising .
 
 The creeper was created as a result of a coding error when creating a pig mob in the pre-alpha stages of  Minecraft' s development in 2009.  [1]   The game's creator,  Markus Persson , accidentally mixed up the dimensions of the model, swapping the length and height. Instead of deleting the result, Persson instead added a green texture believed to be based on the in-game leaves texture to the model, gave it aggressive  AI , and turned it into a hostile mob.  [2]    [3]    [4]    [5]   The creeper was added to the game on September 1, 2009, on a pre-alpha version designated as  0.24_SURVIVAL_TEST_03 .  [4]    [6]    [7]  
 
 In  Minecraft , the player exists in a large world made up of cubes. The world contains a number of enemies, of which creepers are commonly encountered. A creeper is practically silent until it comes near the player, at which point it emits a quiet hiss and detonates after a short delay. The explosion kills the creeper, can kill or injure the player, and also destroys surrounding blocks.  [7]    [8]   In later updates, the  Minecraft  developers decided that creepers "werenâ€™t quite unpredictable enough", and added the ability for creepers to become "charged creepers" when struck by lightning. Charged creepers have amplified explosion power and can cause other mobs killed in the explosion to drop their heads. These heads can then be worn by the player.  [4]    [9]   In an article for   Games and Culture  , Daniel Dooghan characterized the creeper as a " suicide bomber ".  [10]  
 
 The creeper originally appeared in   Minecraft   in a pre-alpha update as a common hostile mob that silently approaches players and hisses, then explodes. It appeared later in  Minecraft  spin-off games such as   Minecraft: Story Mode  ,  [11]     Minecraft Dungeons  ,  [12]     Minecraft Legends    [13]   and   Minecraft Earth  .  [14]  
 
 Outside of  Minecraft , it also appeared in   Terraria   (2011),   Torchlight II   (2012),   Borderlands 2   (2012),   Octodad: Dadliest Catch   (2014),  [15]   and in  Nintendo 's crossover fighting game   Super Smash Bros. Ultimate   (2018), where the creeper has been featured as a  Mii  Brawler costume.  [16]  
 
 The creeper is considered to be one of  Minecraft  ' s most iconic enemies and icons.  [17]   The pixelated face of the creeper has been integrated into the "A" of the Minecraft logo, as well as being used in numerous Halloween costumes and cosplays.  [3]     Guinness World Records Gamer's Edition   listed the creeper as tenth in their list of "top 50 video game villains".  [18]   The creeper has been featured in multiple  Lego Minecraft  sets and has been the main focus of one.  [19]   In 2021,   PC Gamer   ranked creeper as 9th of "the 50 most iconic characters in PC gaming," stating that "The Creeper is the star of  Minecraft , which is ironic considering that the Creeper's effectiveness hinges upon not being seen."  [20]  
 
 The creeper image has been used on a wide variety of Minecraft merchandise, including clothing, bedding and lamps.  [21]    [22]   In July 2020, a joint partnership between  Mojang Studios  and  Kellogg's  led to the announcement of Minecraft Creeper Crunch, an official  Minecraft  branded cereal prominently featuring a creeper on the packaging. It was set to be available for release in stores in the United States in August 2020. Every packet additionally includes a unique code which can be redeemed for a Minecraft  cosmetic  clothing item.  [23]    [24]    [25]  
 
 Creepers have been the subject of numerous pop culture references and parodies. In the season 25 episode " Luca$ " of the animated sitcom   The Simpsons  ,  Moe Szyslak  appears as a creeper and explodes at the end of the theme song's " couch gag ".  [26]    [27]   On August 19, 2011,  Jordan Maron  (also known as the popular  YouTuber  CaptainSparklez) released the song "Revenge", a parody of " DJ Got Us Fallin' in Love ", depicting a  Minecraft  player seeking revenge against creepers. The song regained popularity as an  internet meme  around July 2019.  [28]
